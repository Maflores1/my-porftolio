          <br />I'm Mateo Flores, 20, currently studying Software
          Engineering at Northwestern College. My academic journey started
          with Computer Science at West Virginia State University.
          Originally from <strong>Quito-Ecuador,</strong> I'm passionate
          about tennis and applying my skills to real-world projects for
          organizational growth. Learning and taking on tech challenges
          drive me, and I'm excited to collaborate and contribute value to
          projects.
